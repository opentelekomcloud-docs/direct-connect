Process Description
===================

Connect your on-premises data center to the cloud using Direct Connect to enable on-premises servers to access cloud resources over a private network. To do so, you first need to request a connection to reserve the port used for network communications between your on-premises data center to the Direct Connect location you select. Then, create a virtual gateway and associate it with the VPC, and finally create a virtual interface to connect to the VPC.
