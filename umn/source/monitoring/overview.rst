Monitoring is critical to ensuring the performance, reliability, and availability of a service. Monitoring data lets you keep track of the status of your resources. Cloud Eye collects and displays monitoring data for you in a convenient, visualized manner. You can use Cloud Eye to automatically monitor connections in real time and manage alarms and notifications, so that you can learn the performance of each connection.

.. note::

   After your connection is created, submit a service ticket to enable monitoring for this connection.
