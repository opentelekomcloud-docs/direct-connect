What Factors Do I Need to Consider When Enabling Direct Connect?
================================================================

The following factors need to be considered:

-  Bandwidth: Use the bandwidths provided by the providers.
-  Number of direct connections: Determine whether to create only one connection or two connections for high-reliability redundancy. When PLAS IP/VPN is used, two direct connections are required.
-  Port type when you request direct connections through email or call: 1GE and 10GE are available.
