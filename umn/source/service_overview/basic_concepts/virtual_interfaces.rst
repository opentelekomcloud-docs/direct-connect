Virtual Interfaces
==================

Virtual interfaces associate on-premises gateways with virtual gateways, enabling on-premises data centers to access VPCs.

Virtual interfaces support static routing and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing. During the establishment of network connectivity, you can use BGP to connect on-premises data centers to virtual gateways. BGP helps you build a hybrid cloud more efficiently, flexibly, and reliably.
