Connections
===========

Connections are abstractions of network circuits between Direct Connect locations and on-premises data centers. We provide ports only. After creating a connection, you need to contact the carrier to perform offline construction and set up the physical line for you. Connections are dedicated channels for your on-premises data centers to access VPCs on the cloud. Compared with connections over the public network, Direct Connect connections are more stable, reliable, and secure. They can provide up to 100GE port speed.

Connections support redundant configuration. When there are two connections connected from different locations in the same region, they are mutually redundant and work in active/standby mode. If a connection becomes faulty, services are automatically switched to the other, ensuring stable service running.
