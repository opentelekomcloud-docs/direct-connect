Direct Connect
==============

Direct Connect establishes a high-speed, low-latency, stable, and secure dedicated network connection that connects your on-premises data center to the cloud.

A connection links your on-premises data center to one or more VPCs on the cloud. A virtual gateway is bound to the VPC you want to access. A virtual interface connects your on-premises gateway to the virtual gateway to enable your on-premises data center to access the VPC to build a hybrid cloud. :ref:`Figure 1 <en-us_topic_0032053183__fig1045461015279>` shows how Direct Connect works.

Submit an application to our customer service or sales representative. Our administrator will establish the network connectivity between your on-premises data center and the cloud. Our customer service or sales representative will notify you when the connection is created.

-  After the connection is created, create a virtual gateway and a virtual interface on the Direct Connect console.
-  To disable Direct Connect, you also need to submit an application.
