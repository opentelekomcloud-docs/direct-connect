What Do I Need to Consider When I Want to Enable Direct Connect?
================================================================

Consider the following before you enable Direct Connect:

-  Bandwidth: Use the bandwidths provided by the providers.
-  Number of connections: Determine whether to create only one connection or two connections for high-reliability redundancy. In DC 2.0, two Direct Connect connections are usually used for redundancy.
-  Port speed: The highest port speed can reach 100GE.
